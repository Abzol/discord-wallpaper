# discord-wallpaper

This css file was made to be imported into a custom CSS file for use with 
a [BeautifulDiscord](https://github.com/leovoel/BeautifulDiscord) or similar
Discord alteration.
It allows for custom wallpapers, while retaining most UI elements as background
color hints.

## Getting it working

Copy the full contents of theme.css into your locally-injected CSS file and
replace the background-image URL as you want to. I quite like it.
I took that photo in 2017.
